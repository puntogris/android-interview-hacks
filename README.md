This is a collection of common interview questions with answers that i gathered from various places.

Mainly from here [Mindorks interview questions](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/android-interview-questions)

But most of them have links to answers so i tried to make a resume and added a few more.

Made with Obsidian.
